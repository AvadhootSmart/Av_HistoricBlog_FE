          <p>
            The Taj Mahal, an unparalleled testament to love and architectural
            brilliance, stands as an eternal symbol of romance in the heart of
            Agra, India. Commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory
            of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, the Taj Mahal is a marvel that has
            captivated the world for centuries. Construction of the Taj Mahal

            result is a masterpiece of Indo-Islamic architecture, an ivory-white
            mausoleum that has earned its place as one of the New Seven Wonders
            of the World. The Taj Mahal's architectural splendor lies in its
            perfect symmetry and meticulous detailing. The central structure is
            crowned with a majestic dome, flanked by four minarets, each
            standing at an angle to the main building. The reflective pool in

          <h1>2.Red fort - Delhi</h1>
          <p>
            The Red Fort, or Lal Qila, stands as a magnificent testament to
            India's rich history and architectural grandeur. Situated in the
            heart of Old Delhi, this iconic fortress represents the zenith of
            Mughal architecture and symbolizes the power and opulence of the
            Mughal Empire. Commissioned by the fifth Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan,
            the construction of the Red Fort began in 1638 and was completed in
            1648. The fort served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors
            for almost two centuries, witnessing the rise and fall of this
            illustrious dynasty. The name "Red Fort" owes itself to the striking
            red sandstone used in its construction, which imparts a distinctive
            and imposing appearance. The architectural splendor of the Red Fort
            is a captivating blend of Persian, Timurid, and Indian influences.
            Its massive walls, standing at a height of 33 meters, enclose an
            area of about 254 acres. The fort is laid out in a symmetrical
            pattern, featuring exquisite gardens, pavilions, and water channels
            that once flowed with the waters of the Yamuna River.

            Hawa Mahal, also known as the "Palace of Winds," is a stunning
            architectural gem located in the heart of Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.
            Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the palace is a unique
            structure with a distinctive honeycomb façade. Its five floors are
            adorned with intricate latticework, providing the appearance of a

            to observe daily life and festivals taking place in the street below
            without being seen themselves. The multitude of small windows not
            only served as discreet observation points but also facilitated the
            flow of cool air, giving the palace its name. The delicate pink
            sandstone used in its construction is a hallmark of Jaipur, earning
            it the moniker "Pink City." The palace's architectural style is a
            blend of Rajput and Mughal influences, reflecting the rich cultural
            heritage of Rajasthan. The front elevation, resembling the crown of
            Lord Krishna, further adds to the palace's charm.

          <p>
            The Mahabodhi Temple, located in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, India, is an
            ancient and sacred site associated with the enlightenment of Lord
            Buddha. It stands at the spot where Siddhartha Gautama attained
            enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, making it one of the holiest

            landmark. It marks the location where Prince Siddhartha, after years
            of meditation, attained enlightenment and became the Buddha. The
            temple complex includes the Bodhi tree, an offshoot of the original
            tree under which Buddha meditated. Architectural Splendor: Built
            during the reign of Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE, the
            Mahabodhi Temple is an exemplary model of Indian brick architecture.

          <h1>10.Jallianwala Bagh - Punjab</h1>
          <p>
            Jallianwala Bagh is a solemn historical site in Amritsar, Punjab,
            India, bearing witness to a tragic episode during British rule. On
            April 13, 1919, during the festival of Baisakhi, British troops, led
            by Brigadier General Reginald Dyer, opened fire on a peaceful
            gathering of thousands who had gathered at Jallianwala Bagh. The
            incident, known as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, is a dark chapter
            in Indian history. The walled garden, spread across six to seven
            acres, was a venue for political meetings and gatherings. On that
            fateful day, unaware of martial law imposed by the British, a large
            crowd had assembled to protest the repressive Rowlatt Act. General
            Dyer, without any warning, ordered his troops to open fire on the
            unarmed civilians trapped within the enclosed space.The consequences
            were devastating, with hundreds killed and many more injured. The
            massacre fueled anti-British sentiments across India and played a
            crucial role in shaping the independence movement.
